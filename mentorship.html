							<h2>Undergraduate Involvement in Field Work</h2>
						</header>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/fulls/sophiakilauea.jpg" alt="" /></span>One of my goals within my research is to promote undergraduate research experiences. During my time at UW-Madison, I have been able to get at least one undergraduate student involved as a field assistant during each of my field sessions. Having received a similar opportunity myself as an undergrad, I feel that this involvement helps students narrow down their career goals, while also gaining valuable skills in the field.</p>

							<h2>Mentoring Senior Thesis Students</h2>
						</header>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/patdhp.jpg" alt="" /></span>Another way that I have sought to get undergraduate students involved in research is through providing mentorship on senior theses. This includes working with undergrads to create subprojects related to my own work that will help them gain valuable research experience, as well as providing mentorship to students who are working on research that closely aligns with mine. I have worked with three senior thesis students so far, who have worked to improve our understandings of magma emplacement processes using methods including fabric analyses and gravimetry.</p>

							<h2>Community Involvement</h2>
						</header>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/fulls/VEC Flyer.jpg" alt="" /></span>Since the start of my education in the geosciences, I have found the extensive and kind community to be one of the greatest resources in this field. As a result, I have wanted to give back by participating in departmental service roles. I have served on executive committees for UW-Madison’s AWG chapter, and on the graduate geoscience organizations at ISU and UW-Madison. My graduate peer, Ellen Nelson, and I have also worked to build a ‘Very Early Career’ seminar series at UW-Madison, which showcases research, skill shares, and/or ‘just-for-fun’ geoscience talks by undergraduates, graduates, and post-docs.</p>
