							<h2>Teaching at ISU and UW-Madison</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My teaching experience began at Iowa State University, where I was a lecture/lab assistant for Intro to Geology for Engineers, Physical Geology, and Environmental Geology. </p>
						<p>I have been fortunate to teach Physical Geology at UW-Platteville/Baraboo and TA a wide range of courses of different levels and topics during my graduate degrees. The time spent in these roles have allowed me to develop a passion for teaching and pedagogy, and to gain valuable experience for a future career that includes teaching.</p>
						<p>At UW-Madison, I have been able to assist in a wider range of courses. I have been a lecture/lab assistant for Geology of the National Parks, Introduction to Geologic Structures, Structural Geology, and Intro to Applied Geophysics, and was Head Teaching Assistant for the Wasatch-Uinta Field Camp for three years. During my time at UW-Madison, I was also awarded with an Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award for three separate years. </p>
						<p>Recently, I have been able to take the next step from teaching assistantships to teaching, by taking a role as Lecturer in Physical Geology at UW-Platteville/Baraboo. In this role, I have been able to run a lecture and corresponding lab independently. </p>
						<p>The combination of these experiences has prepared me for teaching a wide range of courses and has made me enthusiastic for future experiences. You can read more about my teaching experience and philosophy below, in my teaching statement.</p>
